## ‚ùì What is PhotoMill X?

PhotoMill X is a professional **batch photo toolkit** for macOS that streamlines repetitive image tasks into a single, automated pipeline. Drag in thousands of files, choose what you need‚Äî**convert, resize, rename, watermark, retouch, strip or edit EXIF/IPTC, add borders, create contact sheets**‚Äîthen run everything in one pass.

Unlike basic converters, PhotoMill X builds **non-destructive workflows** with reusable presets. You can chain adjustments (exposure, contrast, color temperature, sharpening, noise), apply text or image watermarks, standardize color profiles, and output multiple sizes and formats at once (e.g., **JPG/PNG/TIFF/HEIC/WEBP**). A fast preview panel shows the results before processing.

Organization is built-in: **smart renaming rules**, folder mirroring, and metadata templating keep large catalogs consistent for websites, e-commerce, archives, and client deliveries. Powered by native macOS frameworks and fully optimized for **Apple Silicon**, PhotoMill X handles big batches smoothly while preserving image quality.
